	  Say 'Y' here to add support for MediaTek T-PHY driver,
	  it supports multiple usb2.0, usb3.0 ports, PCIe and
	  SATA, and meanwhile supports two version T-PHY which have
	  different banks layout, the T-PHY with shared banks between
	  multi-ports is first version, otherwise is second veriosn,
	  so you can easily distinguish them by banks layout.

config PHY_MTK_USB
	bool "Mediatek usb phy"
	depends on MEDIATEK_SOLUTION
	select GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Say Y here if your system using in-circuit Mediatek USB PHY.
	  If unsure, say N.
	  Enables support for ASIC PHY.
	  This driver provides interface to interact with USB 2.0 and
	  USB 3.0 PHY that is part of the Mediatek SOC.

config PHY_MTK_FPGAPHY
	tristate "MediaTek FPGA-PHY Driver"
	select GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support A60931/A60810 FPGA PHY.
