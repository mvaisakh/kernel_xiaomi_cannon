menuconfig MTK_MTD_NAND
	bool "Nand support based on Mediatek nand controller"
	depends on MTD
	help
	  NAND flash memory, a type of non-volatile storage device,
	  introduced by Toshiba in 1989. With formal commands,
	  controller can access data via devices.
	  This configuration enable Mediatek NAND controller to perform
	  operations on NAND devices of verious vendors.
	  For products choosing raw NAND as booting device,this configuration
	  must say y.
	  Since kernel using MTD as storage device common driver,
	  this configuration depends on MTD_NAND config.
	  Please visit JEDEC sites for more information.

config MTK_TLC_NAND_SUPPORT
	bool "Support TLC Nand based on Mediatek nand controller"
	depends on MTK_MTD_NAND
	help
	  In electronics, TLC is a memory element capable of
	  storing more than a single bit of information.
	  TLC NAND flash is a flash memory technology using multiple levels per
	  cell to allow more bits to be stored using the same number of
	  transistors.
	  The primary benefit of TLC flash memory is its lower cost per unit of
	  storage due to the higher data density, and memory-reading software
	  can compensate for a larger bit error rate.
	  Thus,firmware and driver to support TLC devices need to take care of
	  data robustness, and TLC features with extend command and storage
	  methods.
	  Compatible with SLC, MLC and TLC, Mediatek controller driver and
	  firmware have implement various method to enhance data robustness.
	  While using TLC devices as booting device, please set this
	  configuration as y to enable TLC features.

config MNTL_SUPPORT
	bool "Mediatek MNTL driver"
	depends on MTK_MTD_NAND
	help
	  MNTL designed by Mediatek own FTL for block device support,
	  And It is Mediatek Nand Translation Layer.
	  For mlc or tlc nand support this feature need to be opened.
	  Enable this feature if want to use MNTL handle nand management.
